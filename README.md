# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory


Disclaimer i created this file in github and pulled it down to my local computer before creating the react app within this directory, and ifyou look on the tag line it will show you i have made numerous commits to this repo but it has tallied on my over contributon amount due to the fact that the actual React app file is located in this overall Repo.
## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Challenges
This was an exciting application that pushed my technical abilities to their limit but non the less was able to over come the majority of them and 
the main one which was getting the api call to render on the sight throgh the use of React for the first time! But there were two that i am
still trying to work the kinks out of which are the sorting and the filtering.
