# UserDirectory
## Intro
##Overview
For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

##User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


##Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

##Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.

## Challenges
The challenegs i faced in this homewok was trying to get a filter for my cearch bar as well as my sorting figured, however was able to get the information to render through the use of react components which made it easy to render
the data to the page once the correct syntax was given..
